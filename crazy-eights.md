## Overview 

This exercise is a great way to time box the sketching in workshops and sprints with a group of 2-6 people.  

* Helps people feel the creative rush and let loose
* Helps the team to start quickly visualizing the product


## Our Approach

1. Give each person a 11 x 17 sheet of paper with 8 boxes
2. Set a timer for 8 minutes
3. Ask the team to fill all boxes with idea sketches in 8 minutes
4. Pencils down when timer goes off
5. Ask everyone to tape up their sketches and do a quick presentation of their 2 top ideas
6. Give everyone stickers or post-its and ask them to go around and vote for their favorite ideas

## How long does this take? 

8 minutes - You can do multiple rounds but keep them short

## Outcome 

* Makes the team think of bigger picture items and not on the details of the features. 
* Allows a variety of ideas come to light quickly
