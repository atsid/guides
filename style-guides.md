## Overview 

Style guides are built to show clients and team members the visual direction of a product. This guide will include:

* Typography 
* Color
* Imagery 
* Icons
* UI Elements

## Why use this exercise?

This exercise defines the **Look and Feel** for a project. It serves as a reference for both developers and designers to keep visual consistency throughout the product.

## Our approach

For a more holistic technical approach, we include our style guides as part of the [pattern library]({{site.baseurl}}/pattern-library).

## How long does this take?

There are iterations and sign-offs involved to have a final style guide completed but this is can take anywhere from (**TODO**)

## Outcome

Everyone is on the same page when it comes to how the product and brand has been established to look.
