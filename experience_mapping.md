## Overview 

An experience map is a visual narrative of a user's journey through their interaction with your product or service. 
 
## Why use this exercise? 

This inforgraphic will start to show you what may be challenges or pain points for the user, but better yet areas of opportunity to solve for the them.  


## Our Approach 

While creating this map consider actions or occurrences the user is experiencing. These include what are they doing, thinking, feeling and their surroundings while using your product. Remember to always keep the (user requirements) and (personas) in mind while creating these experience maps. 

1. Write down the project's and user's programming needs. Try creating this by answering the following questions.

   *What are the end-user's goals?
   *Who is involed during this experience?
   *What device or technology is being used?
   *Are there major decision points?
   *Where are they located?

2. Identify and group the decision making or changing points in the journey into phases. These phases are points in which the user :

  *shows a change in behavior
  *uses new information
  *makes a decision
  *changes environment or device

3. Show your visual narrative to the team and stakeholders. Give them the main points of insights where you found opportunity for design solutions.

4. Get the teams input and record all new discoveries and insights from the discussion. 


## How long does this take? 

This is a 8 -12 hr exercise.
