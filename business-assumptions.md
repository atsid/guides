## Overview 

> "If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong." - Dr. Richard Feynman

In every project, there are assumptions being made by the team regarding important considerations such as:

* Who is/are our user(s)?
* What is the best way to provide value to our customers?
* Who are our customers?
* Who are our competitors?
* What is/are the most important problem(s) to solve?

And many more. By identifying these assumptions early in the process, we can determine ways to test the assumption and get data that will help mitigate the risk of being wrong. 

There are many exercises that can help do this. This exercise was created by Giff Constable and found in the Lean UX book by Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden. It provides a quick way for a team to determine their individual assumptions and then share them see how they differ within the team. 

## Why use this exercise? 

Often times, something that seems obvious to a team member changes when they see that there are multiple perspectives in the group. Having the team outline their assumptions individually allows each team member to be heard by reducing the possibility of group thinking.  Also, by providing a guideline of areas to focus assumptions on, it makes it easy to see how team views differ. 

Note: The worksheet is simply meant as a guideline. Teams can and should edit it to fit the needs of their project. Instructions should also be given to the group to feel free to add any additional assumptions they have that might not fit into the categories on the worksheet.

## Our approach 

* <b>Step 1: Complete the assumptions exercise individually.</b> Each member of your team should prepare answers for the questions that follow on their own. This includes your clients.
* <b>Step 2: Share your answers.</b> Get together with your team (and client) to kick off the new initiative. Go around the table sharing everyone’s answers to the assumptions exercise, question by question.
* <b>Step 3: Collect, organize, prioritize.</b> Collect these answers on sticky notes or a whiteboard and sort them into themes. As a team, attempt to prioritize which themes are most important for each question. Don’t worry if you get to the end of the exercise without clear agreement on all of the answers. The goal is to collect statements that reflect what you and your team think might be true. If you have strong disagreement on a point, capture the different perspectives.

## How long does this take?

Six timeboxed sessions that run "5-10 min max" or you can do multiple rounds of “Crazy 8’s”.

## Outcome

A fast, diverse perspective and ideas on your new product. This exercise is meant to focus on quantity of ideas versus the quality. Once the top ideas have been discussed and narrowed or combined the product should have a direction.
