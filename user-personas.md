## Overview 

Personas are profiles of end-users modeled after real people. The personas establish the product’s key audience goals and behaviors found through interviewing and researching. 
 
## Why use this exercise?

Personas help us define the user and identify their needs and limitations. It keeps the team thinking subjectively of the end-user and the product.

Persona information includes:

* Name
* Profession
* Demographics
* Tasks and end-goals while using your product
* Physical, social, tech environments
* A non-stock photo or portrait of the persona

## Our approach

* Conduct user research: Answer the following questions: Who are your users and why are they using the system? What behaviors, assumptions, and expectations color their view of the system?
* Condense the research: Look for themes/characteristics that are specific, relevant, and universal to the system and its users.
* Brainstorm: Organize elements into persona groups that represent your target users. Name or classify each group.
* Refine: Combine and prioritize the rough personas. Separate them into primary, secondary, and, if necessary, complementary categories. You should have roughly 3-5 personas and their identified characteristics.
* Make them realistic: Develop the appropriate descriptions of each personas background, motivations, and expectations.
* Have the information found through the user interviews and research direct you in how to create these personas.

**TODO: include examples of personas created in past projects**

## Outcome

Personas become a guide to our team and clients, they show us the user's goals, motivation of use, devices used, and pain points they may have while using the product.
