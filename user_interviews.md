## Overview 

Typically 30 min - 1 hour long 1-1 conversations between researcher and participant. It is all about putting yourself in other people’s shoes. 

## Why this exercise?

It is all about the users who are people. Interviews are conducted to get to know who you are designing for. 

Things to acknowledge while doing this exercise :

*Ask open-ended questions
*Ask about actual behavior not intention 
*Avoid leading questions by pointing out specifics 
*Avoid compound questions

##Our Approach

>“If you just talk to who’s easy to talk to, you’re not really getting the best data.” - Emmett Shear

After identifying and recruiting participants we prepare topics and questions to discuss. 

When preparing questions we consider the following :
*What do we need to know about the topic?
*Craft unbiased questions
*Think of possible types of responses and how you can guide those responses
*Write potential follow-up questions

When conducting the interview : 
*Make the participants feel 100% comfortable
*Use the questions more as a guide rather than a script
*Always ask for permission if you are recording audio or video
*Explain the reason for the interview
*Try to make it be more like a conversation rather than a 
*If possible have a team member observe and take notes of the interview


##Additional thoughts

*Try listening twice as much as you speak
*Do not feel the need to fill in silence 
*Do not interrupt, listen
*Make sure to pull quotes, This is helpful when presenting your ideas to the team and stakeholders.

Here are a few ways to keep the interviewee talking :
* “Tell me more about…”
* “What do you mean by....”
* “Help me understand better …”
