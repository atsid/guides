## Overview 

Originating with the design team at GV (formerly Google Ventures), the Design Sprint is a workshop method that is meant to be a vigorous but productive 5-day exercise used to solve and test problems fast.

### Team members

The ideal team size for this exercise is 5-8 people and should comprise of the following:

* Sprint Master
* Designers
* Engineers
* Product Managers
* Researcher
* Subject Experts

### Supplies needed
* Sharpies
* Paper
* Tape
* Sticky Notes
* Voting dots
* Timer
* Chime Bell or Kitchen Timer
* Snacks and Coffee are always useful too

Our offices maintain Design Sprint Kits with everything required so you can grab and go.

## Why this exercise? 

It obligates the team to keep a narrow focus and solve for design problems quickly.

## Our approach 

The sprint master leads the team with a clear calendar through the 6 sprint stages as seen below.

## Understand or empathize

We discuss and learn all we can about who is using this product. Before we get started we make sure the team has a shared understanding of the User needs, Technology Capability and Business Goals of the product.

## Define

We start to define the customer profiles of the users. Start defining the central journey.

## Diverge or ideate

After identifying the key users and content of the new product, we started with ideas that could lead to an app. This is where everyone starts sketching on their own first.

* A great exercise to use during this stage is the [Crazy Eights]({{site.baseurl}}/crazy-eights) method.

## Decide

As a team we select the top 1-3 ideas to prototype.

## Prototype

We create a rapid prototype of the top idea without spending too much time, money, or resources. This can be as simple as PowerPoint/Keynote slides, on up to a clickable coded prototype, depending on the time available and complexity.

## Validate

Is this idea any good? Have 5 people test.

## How long does this take?

5 days max.

## Outcome
