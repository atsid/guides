## Why this exercise? 

It obligates the team to keep a narrow focus and solve for design problems quickly. 

## Our Approach 

The sprint master leads the team with a clear calendar through the 6 sprint stages as seen below.

## Understand or Empathize
We discuss and learn all we can about who is using this product but before we get started we make sure the team has a shared understanding of the User needs, Technology Capability and Business Goals of the product.

## Define
We start to define the customer profiles of the users. Start defining the central journey.

## Diverge or Ideate
After identifying the key users and content of the new product, we started with ideas that could lead to an app. This is where everyone starts sketching on their own first. 

* Great exercise to use during this stage is the Crazy Eights Method. 

## Decide
As a team we select the top 1-3 ideas to prototype. 

## Prototype
We create a rapid prototype of the top idea without spending too much time, money, or resources. 

## Validate
Is this idea any good?” Have 5 people test 

## How long does this take? 
5 days max

## Outcome
