## Overview 

Site map is a diagram used to show the structure of a website or mobile device. It helps define the taxonomy of a product through grouping and linking related content.
 
## Why use this exercise? 

It facilitates as a reference point for functional specifications and information architecture for the team and clients. 

*Shows navigation structure
*Identifies where content placement and what needs to be produced
*Helps show the relationship between the different screens or pages on a site.

## Our Approach 
  
We create site maps once the (user requirements), (user content) and (user journey) have been identified. The (card-sorting) exercise is a great way to identify this information and the cards and (user scenerio) can help you start mapping out the flow.
