## Overview

Competitive or comparative analysis can tell us a lot about industry conventions and how we may differentiate our product from what already exists. This analysis also helps align business with design to define and prioritize product goals.

## Why use this exercise?

This exercise shows us how we can improve and differentiate our product from other competitors. We learn a lot by understanding what works or has failed in a existing product. Also shows us how we may use interactions or references from different industry types.

## Our approach

Who is our competitor? We start by identifying similar industries and researching the product or methods they currently use. The team needs to establish a metric for business or heuristic features of the competitor's product you are evaluating.

Use a matrix chart of your choice to visually portray the products disconnects or successes.

## How long does this take?

A couple hours depending on the project scope.

## Outcome

We gain an understanding of product or industry setbacks of what has been previously designed. It shows us areas of opportunities for our product.
