## Overview 

Diagrams that visually illustrate how words, phrases, ideas, or concepts relate to a central key word. They are a visual thinking map that helps to structure information and identify connections between items and ideas.

## Our Approach

We use mind maps as an individual warm-up exercise prior to a group brainstorming session. This is meant to be a rough and fast-paced sketch of personal ideas and notes. 

*Start with a word or phrase that you are exploring and draw a circle around it
*When you think of a related fact draw a line out from the circle 
*Branch the words out and title them with single word or simple phrases
*You will be begin to see the words connecting
