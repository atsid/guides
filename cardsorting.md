## Overview 

Card-sorting is a quick way to see how users would navigate through the content. Helps the team determine key content and evaluate the Information Architecture of the site. 


## Our Approach 

There are two types of card-sorting techniques. There is open and closed card sorting. 

*###Open card-sorting: This method is used to see how users naturally without guidance group content and label those groups.

1. Give the testing participants a collection of the project content.
2. Ask the participants to sort or seperate the cards in the catagories they feel makes sense to them
3. Ask them to explain their thoughts behind the grouping of the content. 

*###Closed card-sorting: This method is used when you have pre-determined groups of content or topics. Helps see how users apply the content into those specific groups.

1. Give the testing participants a collection of the project content.
2. Ask the participants to sort or seperate the cards in the specified groups or topics you have pre-determined.  
3. As they are sorting ask them to explain why they are choosing to assign the content into that specific group. 

## How long does this take? 

1 - 3 hours
