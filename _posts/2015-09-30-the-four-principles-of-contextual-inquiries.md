Before you can improve a product, or create a product that’s an improvement on existing offerings, you have to know what users need and turn them into requirements. Gathering requirements isn’t simply a matter of asking users what they need. Just asking people what they want doesn’t work because people generally don’t know what technology is capable of, and they’re really bad at explaining what they do day-to-day. So much of a person’s work is habitual and done unconsciously, making it difficult or impossible to articulate.

People are pretty good at telling you what they’re frustrated with, but they’ll usually leave out the workarounds they invented to overcome the product’s limitations. They do often suggest functionality, but these suggestions don’t reveal the consequences, motivations, and core values behind them. If you can uncover these, you’ll discover insights that you can leverage in your product’s design that will absolutely delight your users.

This article explains how we at ATS discover these motivations and core values through a research method called a Contextual Inquiry Interview.
