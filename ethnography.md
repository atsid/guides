##Overview 

Ethnography also known as field research or field studies are research activities conducted outside of the office and in the user's environment. Observing users in their environment is the best way to see true actions and frustrations with the experience you are re-designing. 

The way you approach or choose to conduct your research may vary. The two main ways are by either interacting with the user's or by observation only.  

Here is a list provided by [Field Studies by Susan Farrell](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/field-studies) describing the different approaches. 

###Examples of field studies include:

*Flexible user tests in the field, which combine usability testing with adaptive interviews. Interviewing people about their tasks and challenges gives you very rich information. In an adaptive interview, you refine the questions you ask as you learn.

*Customer visits can help you better understand usability issues that arise in particular industry or business contexts or those that appear at a certain scale.

*Direct observation is useful for conducting design research into user processes, for instance to help create natural task flows for subsequent paper prototypes. Direct observation is also great for learning user vocabulary, understanding businesses’ interaction with customers, and discovering common workarounds — for example by listening in on support calls, watching people moving through amusement parks, or observing sales staff and customers in stores.

*Ethnographic research situates you in the users’ context as a member of the group. Group research allows you to gain insight into mental models and social situations that can help products and services fit into people’s lives. This type of research is particularly helpful when your target audience lives in a culture different from yours.

*Contextual inquiry is a method that structures and combines many of these field-study activities.

##Advantages and Disadvantages

###Advantage

*Provides the most indepth aspects of the user's enviroment
*Behavioral responses to interactions are best understood within the user's natural environment. 

###Disadvantages

*If interacting or seen by the users, observer bias occurs.  
*Quantitative data analysis is close to impossible since the exercise is qualitative by nature. 

##Our Approach
 
During discovery and prior to design phase in our process we ask ourselves, Do we know enough about the user and their environment? 

*Find the applicable organization and environment your product would eventually be used in. 
*Determine if you will be interviewing or only be observing. For either scenerio you need to develop a (user interview) script or (research plan) to guide your focus on the necessary specifics for your product.
