## Why use this exercise?

* Post-it notes and wall space tend to be very budget friendly.
* All team members can participate and have fun building a visually compelling source of information.
* Did we mention post-it notes? They are perfect for this exercise since this is a fluid exercise that involves a lot of peeling and moving of words, but if you happen to be a team with remote members this can also be achieved by using tools such as [LucidCHart](https://www.lucidchart.com) or [MemoSort](https://memosort.com)

## Our Approach 

1. Brief your participants with the project details and objectives
2. Have the participants take 5 minutes without talking, write down as many words or ideas they can think of on separate post-it notes. They can immediately start sticking them on the wall in no particular order.
3. Pencils down once the 5 minutes are up
4. As a group now take a look at the words or ideas displayed. 
5. Start discussing and grouping the ones that are similar. See what higher level categories start forming. 
6. Do one more braindump round of words after the categories have been formed. Allow for everyone to discuss and move ideas around to the categories they think their ideas best fit. 
7. Take note of the categories and the specific words or ideas that have falling under this group type.
8. You have identified top priority topics of importance for your product. For more information, check out  [www.designorate.com/using-the-affinity-diagram](http://www.designorate.com/using-the-affinity-diagram).
