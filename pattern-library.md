## Overview

Project resource that defines UI elements and their properties. It serves as a guideline for both designers and developers.
 
## Why use this exercise?

Helps an ongoing project stay consistent with its visual and interactive components. Helps developers implement patterns that have been established and use them for new features.

## Our approach

We like to include our [style guide]({{site.baseurl}}/style-guide) into the pattern library to keep visual components not only consistent but maintainable. Open source design library allows for anybody to gain access to our patterns. We also like to get feedback to stay abreast of new UI trends.
