## Overview 

Flat diagrammatic representation of a product's interface.  Wireframes are used to show specific space allocations for interactive elements. They do not typically show any styling, color, images or graphics. Hand-sketched or digital templates show the placement and hierarchy of components in your product. 

*Low-fidelity wireframes: These ase are simple and quick. They are more of an abstract view to show screen space. 
*High-fidelity wireframes: Are of higher detail to show the actions and behaviors of an interactive element. These include specific content placement and are better format to use as documentation of your product. 
 
## Why use this exercise? 

*Helps connect the content into a visual representation by clarifying the user flows through the product's screens or pages. 
*Identifies the patterns or consistant variables of information throughout the product. 
*Show how much space elements such as forms or buttons need on a screen
*Allows for the team to start communicating internally to get feedback on how feasible the elements are for the product. 

## Our Approach 

*Start with higher weight items such as logo, navigation and search bars
*Draft the placement of these items in the screen size your product is planned to be. 
*Use very generic fonts and blocks to not distract from the main items. Helpful tools are OmniGraffle and Axure. 
*Review your screens to make sure they are consitant with the user requirments and user scenarios.


## How long does this take?
